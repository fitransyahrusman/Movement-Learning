# Space Shooter Project
 My learning progress for 2D for Unity.
 
 Hi,

I made this game from scratch with guidance of paid course in Unity.
However when I post this repo the project is already 30% of progress.
Here all the accomplished features : 
1. Making player gameobject, functionality : Movement, Input and Firing with Laser prefab
2. Making Enemy with behaviour, spawning system and damage system with player and laser.
3. Making power ups, create modular script for 2 power ups and implementing behaviour of each power ups (triple shoot and speed)
And from here the next changes should be reflected in commit, hope you enjoy.

Cheers, 
Fitransyah
